## Fractals

A repository for exploring fractal geometries, with a particular (exclusive?) focus on interesting L-systems.

### L-systems

An L-system (Lindenmayer system) is "a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar."

It consists of an alphabet of symbols and a set of production rules for each character
